# Experimental product generator

There is an experimental feature in the Workflow Orchestrator called the
generator. Based on a YAML file that describes the product and product blocks,
it can generate a large amount of boilerplate code. The code includes product
and product block models, skeleton create, modify, terminate and validate
workflows, unit tests for this, and the database migration.

This folder contains an example description of the node and circuit products
and the code that can be generated based on that.
